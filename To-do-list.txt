Pokemon Exp Calculator:

Add a "menu" that let's you choose which mode;
-Current one (most efficient way)
-One where you only catch one type of pokemon, displaying as if you transfer all the pokemon and evolve only that type
-One where calculates how many more of pokemon you'll need to catch to evolve into final evolution (counting 4 per catch and
transfering ALL the ones currently possess / choosing how many of current to transfer)
Add more!



MAKE IT SO IT TAKES THE ANSWER CHOICE OF MODE DE-CAPITALIZED SO IT DOES NOT MATTER HOW THE CAPITILIZATION IS!!



Eventually insert number of candies needed to evolve a pokemon, like they insert a pokemon, and code accesses databank and 
finds the right number of candies for that pokemon to evolve.
example:
pokename = raw_input("What pokemon will you be catching?")
pokedict = {"pidgey" : 12, "weedle" : 12, caterpie : 12, }
